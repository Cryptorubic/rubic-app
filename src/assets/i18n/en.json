      "QUESTION": "What is Rubic?",
      "ANSWER": "Rubic is a multichain DeFi ecosystem, which features cross-chain, P2P, and instant swaps across multiple blockchains, aiming to deliver a complete ONE-STOP decentralized platform."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Who can use our service?",
      "ANSWER": "Anyone who wants to create and manage their tokens, or either owns a cryptocurrency and wishes to exchange it. KYC is not required."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What are the minimum and maximum trade size?",
      "ANSWER": "There are no limits."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How does it work?",
      "ANSWER": "There are two options for trading:\n First, you create a trade on your own terms and wait till another part agrees with them and fills his share.\n Second, you choose the instant trade option and you will automatically get the market rates.\n\nYou can create your own token without any coding skills and trade it without having to be listed."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Which cryptocurrencies are supported?",
      "ANSWER": "At the moment, Rubic allows trading for Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20) and Binance Smart Chain tokens (BEP-20). More blockchains will be implemented soon (see Roadmap). However, to create and manage tokens we already provide multichain services supported by Ethereum, Tron, EOS, NEO and Binance Smart Chain."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "Should I list my token before using your service?",
      "ANSWER": "No, you can trade any tokens, by manually add their contract addresses. However, you can contact us and we will add your token to our list."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to start?",
      "ANSWER": "It is easy and fast. You only need the MetaMask crypto wallet (more wallets will be supported). Choose the blockchain in which you want to swap tokens, and choose to trade either with Instant Trades or Order Book."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to create a trade?",
      "ANSWER": "Order Book:\nStep 1: Select your blockchain in which you want to swap tokens and choose Order Book. \nStep 2:  Choose the tokens you want to exchange, at your desired rate.\nStep 3: Choose advanced options, such as closing date and time, minimum and maximum contribution, privacy, brokerage fee, lock liquidity until the trade completion. \nStep 4: Check details of the trade. \nStep 5: Click Create Trade.\nStep 6: Use MetaMask to confirm your trade. \nStep 7: Contribute to your part of the deal.\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FCHTOT9Z9k' target='_blank'>Video tutorial (this method works for any blockchain)</a>\n\nInstant Trades:\nStep 1: Select Instant Trades and fill out the form, by choosing the tokens you want to exchange.\nStep 2: Enter the desired amount you want to exchange.\nStep 3: Now, the DEX aggregator, will automatically show you the best rates across multiple protocols.\nStep 4: Press Create trade button.\nStep 5: Use MetaMask to confirm your trade, and now wait for the transaction to be confirmed into the blockchain.\n<a href='https://youtu.be/kxg9GQvBU2A' target='_blank'>Video tutorial</a>\n"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How much does it cost?",
      "ANSWER": "Currently, our service doesn't charge any fee for Instant Trades, neither for the Order Book trades."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How long does it take to complete a deal?",
      "ANSWER": "For the Order Book trades, the deal will be completed as soon as the other side completes its side.\nFor the Instant Trades, the deal will be completed as soon as it gets confirmed on the blockchain."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How the privacy and security of the transaction are ensured?",
      "ANSWER": "The deal is secured by smart contracts verified by experienced developers and external audit."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How many people can participate in one deal (Order Book)?",
      "ANSWER": "Up to 10 people can participate on each side."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "What will happen if the second part doesn’t complete a deal (P2P)?",
      "ANSWER": "After its expiration date, you will need to go to your trades table and click on 'Withdraw', this way you will get your tokens back (network fee will apply)."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "If I created a deal, however, I have changed my mind, can I cancel it?",
      "ANSWER": "For Order Book trades: Yes, you can cancel your deal any time before the part starts completing their side. If you cancel a deal, you'll get your tokens back.\nFor Instant Trades: Most of the time, the answer is NO. This action is actually an attempt to overwrite a currently pending transaction with a new one. Please check <a href='https://info.etherscan.com/how-to-cancel-ethereum-pending-transactions/' target='_blank'>official external services info</a>"

      "QUESTION": "How to add Binance Smart Chain and Matic networks to MetaMask?",
      "ANSWER": "<a href='/assets/book.pdf' target='_blank'>Please click here for more details.</a>"
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How to use cross-chain bridge?",
      "ANSWER": "Step 1. Install MetaMask wallet (<a href='www.metamask.io' target='_blank'>www.metamask.io</a>) and connect it to Rubic.exchange. \n\nStep 2. Choose your exchange destination (from Ethereum to Binance or vice-versa). You can switch your destination by clicking on the swap arrows button. \n\nStep 3. Currently, users are able to swap 25 ERC20 tokens with their corresponding BEP20 version, and vice-versa (and the list keeps getting updated). The list of tokens:\nUSDT to BUSDT-T (Tether)\nETH to ETH (Ethereum)\nBBTC to BTCB (Bitcoin)\nBBCH to BCH (Bitcoin Cash)\nBDOT to DOT (Polkadot)\nBFIL to FIL (Filecoin)\nSNX to SNX (Synthetix Network Token)\nDAI to DAI (Dai Stablecoin)\nBAND to BAND (BandToken)\nBAT to BATBasic (Attention Token)\nLINK to LINK (ChainLink)\nUNI to UNI (Uniswap)\nYFII to YFII (DFI.Money)\nYFI to YFI (yearn.finance)\nBUSD to BUSD (Binance USD)\nCOMP to COMP (Compound)\nMKR to MKR (Maker)\nTCT to TCTToken (Club Token)\nIOTX to IOTX (IoTeX)\nBEL to BEL (Bella Protocol)\nELF to ELF (aelf)\nPAX to PAX (Paxos Standard)\nUSDC to USDC (USD Coin)\nINJ to INJ (Injective Protocol)\nSXP to SX (Swipe)\n\n\nStep 4. Enter the number of tokens you want to swap (check below the minimum and maximum amount of tokens that you’re able to exchange). Proceed next if you are satisfied with the returning amount of tokens (this includes the Binance fee).\n\nStep 5. You can view tokens' contracts by clicking on 'Check on Etherscan/BSCscan'.\n\nStep 6.  Click Create Swap, followed by MetaMask's trade confirmation. \n\nStep 7. Please wait until the transaction will be recorded in the blockchain. Once your transaction is accepted you will be notified. You can find the transaction details in the table. Please wait until the Binance will process it as well."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "I'm not able to use cross-chain swaps, it appears I have exceeded the limit. What should I do?",
      "ANSWER": "Please wait and try again later, as currently there is a limit of 3 cross-chain swaps in 30 minutes. This will soon improve."
    }, {
      "QUESTION": "How long does it take to complete a cross-chain swap?",
      "ANSWER": "It usually varies, and this does not depend on us, but on the two blockchains.\nAs estimations we have 2 minutes for initialization, then 4 minutes for feedback waiting, and another couple of  minutes for deposit. \n\nThe current average time is approximately 10 minutes.\n"
