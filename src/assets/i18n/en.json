        "answer": "Reason:\n This usually happens when you are trying to swap a token with its taxes included. \n\n How to solve:\n To fix the “Pancake: K” error, you need to change slippage. Also, you can try to change the number of tokens that you are trying to swap. \nLet’s say that you’re trying to swap 10000 Token A for BNB. To fix this, you need to change the last number of Token A. For example, instead of inputting “10000”, change it to “10001”.\n You can also try to decrease the number of tokens you are trying to swap."

        "answer": "Reason:\n Temporal malfunction of the RPC used in the wallet for the chosen network.\nIf this error occurs, the transaction has not been sent and the money will not be debited from your wallet. \n\n How to solve:\n Due to the temporal malfunction of the RPC used in the wallet for the chosen network, it can rectify itself over time. You can also try to resend the transaction or just wait a while.\nIf if you have tried 2 to 3 times and nothing helps, there is another solution to try: change the RPC to the relevant one, you can find out how to do it and which RPC is relevant at the current moment in time in the support chat on the website, or in our Telegram: <a href='https://t.me/RubicSupportBot' target='_blank'>https://t.me/RubicSupportBot</a>."

Increase your slippage % tolerance.\n 3. Lastly, try inputting an amount with fewer decimal places or remove the decimals, if at all possible."

If you transfer a non-native token, a value exceeding the available balance has been entered in the “Amount” field. \nAlso, please check that you have connected the proper wallet and you have enough tokens for the swap.\nThe fee is shown on the transfer screen before you confirm the transfer. Deduct this amount from the total amount you're sending out, and your transfer will go through."

      "7": {
        "title": "What can I do if I get the “TRANSFER_FAILED” error?",

If you want to sell the maximum possible, try 70% or 69% instead of 100%.\nAnother possible cause of this issue is the malicious token issuer just suspended the trading of their token. That, or they made the action of selling only possible for selected wallet addresses. Please always do your own research to avoid any potential fraud. If the token you are trying to swap fails with this error code, it is likely coming from an airdrop that is most likely a scam. Please do not perform any token approvals or follow any links, otherwise your funds may be at risk if you try to do so."

You have accelerated the transaction in your wallet and will receive the desired tokens, you can find out information about the transaction in the “Replaced by Txn Hash\" tab.\n2. You probably cancelled the transaction by mistake. The assets will not be debited from your address, but the gas fee will not be refunded back to you."

        "title": "Why was my Multi-chain transaction canceled?",
        "answer": "Sometimes transactions become cancelled. It depends on a few causes: slippage and token rate.\nMulti-Chain swap cannot be completed as fast as Instant Trades, since it needs to be realised as an Instant Swap on both networks.\nThe reason for the cancellation may be a change in the price of the token and you would have received below the expected “Minimum Received” amount of tokens. \nFor a refund, please contact our support team via chat on the website or Telegram: <a href='https://t.me/RubicSupportBot' target='_blank'>https://t.me/RubicSupportBot</a>"

        "answer": "The Rubic Relay is a great solution for the problems projects face regarding low user turnover.\nIt keeps users on your website, transforming trades into a simple action: the Relay offers users and project owners the function of buying and selling tokens on their own project’s webpage, leading users to stay on your website for longer out of sheer utility.\nThe Relay is also scalable across different devices, and it’s possible to change the colours and size of the Relay widget itself as well.\n\nHere is a detailed instructional guide for the Relay’s integration:\n <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ULxjzN3sVc2indb5-_PtR7v7jui_tCJ7/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ULxjzN3sVc2indb5-_PtR7v7jui_tCJ7/view?usp=sharing</a>"
