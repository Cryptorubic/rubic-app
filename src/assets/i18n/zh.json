        "answer": "Rubic is a multichain DeFi ecosystem, which features cross-chain swaps, instant swaps and much more. Our aim is to deliver a complete ONE-STOP decentralized trading platform. The Rubic platform is a place where users can complete cross-chain swaps utilizing different solutions, where users will get the best rates from all the leading swap protocols (thanks to a DEX aggregator implementation), as well as buying MATIC or BNB directly via our Crypto Tap.\n\nAt the moment, Rubic supports trades on Ethereum, Polygon (ex Matic), and Binance Smart Chain networks and cross-chain swaps between Ethereum, Polygon (ex Matic), and Binance Smart Chain, xDai and TRON networks."
      },
      "1": {
        "title": "Who can use our service?",
        "answer": "Our service can be used in any part of the world by crypto users who would like to complete trades on different networks and complete cross-chain swaps between them. Our features also include services for other projects: creation of the custom bridges and integration of Rubic Relay widget, which allows users to complete trades directly at service website using Rubic. \tKYC is not required for any operations at Rubic.exchange"
      },
      "2": {
        "title": "What are the minimum and maximum trade sizes?",

      },
      "3": {
        "title": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "There are numerous features that Rubic provides to its users. These features include:\n\nInstant Trades - Complete a trade between different assets using different blockchains and DEXs, all on one platform.\n\nRubic Routing system - Complete an instant trade while getting the best rates on the market.\n\nCross-Chain Swaps - Complete a swap between different networks using integrated and created bridges between those networks.\n\nCrypto Tap - Easily buy MATIC or BNB without ever needing KYC/VPNs, using either RBC or ETH. If RBC is used for the Tap, you’ll also get a discounted rate.\n\nThe Rubic platform also provides the services of Custom Bridge creation, platform listings, Rubic Relay Widget integrations and will soon offer cross-chain routing.\n\nThe Rubic Relay is a great solution for the problems projects face regarding low user turnover.\nIt keeps users on your website, transforming trades into a simple action: the Relay offers users and project owners the function of buying and selling tokens on their own project’s webpage, leading users to stay on your website for longer out of sheer utility.\nThe Relay is also scalable across different devices, and it’s possible to change the colours and size of the Relay widget itself as well."

      "4": {
        "title": "Which cryptocurrencies are supported?",
        "answer": "At the moment, Rubic allows trading for Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20),  Binance Smart Chain tokens (BEP-20), and on the Polygon network. For cross-chain swaps Rubic also allows users to transfer their assets between Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, xDai and TRON networks. \nMore blockchains will be implemented soon.\n\nAt the same time, thanks to our partnership, MyWish users can create and manage tokens. We also provide multichain services supported by Ethereum, Tron, EOS, NEO, and Binance Smart Chain.\n"

Users will be able to swap more BNB and MATIC than normal and pay less RBC at the same time.\n\nCommission fees in ETH is 0.02, and in RBC is just 150 RBC or about 0.007 ETH worth at the current market prices at the time of writing this article."

        "title": "How does Rubic unite different DEX platforms? ",
        "answer": "Users will be able to choose the suitable DEX protocol in order to get the best tokens rates with the lowest gas prices. Rubic always analyzes and compares all the variants, and comes up with the best rate. Please notice that while checking all the alternatives we consider the GAS fee. Rubic strives to provide users with the best exchange opportunities. "

      "16": {
        "title": "Why do we need to make a choice between different providers?",
        "answer": "The gas fees and price rates of these protocols are different, therefore the opportunity of having more options empowers the users to make better trading decisions.\n\nMoreover, Rubic created a routing solution that will allow users to trade any token on BSC, Polygon and Ethereum networks. Our self-created routing system for Ethereum has several advantages over the Uniswap routing system. The main advantage is the ability to calculate gas prices and show users the best-optimized solution while paying the least amount of gas.\n\nOur routing system gives users lower prices on their swaps than most DEXs. Users will receive quotes for lower prices in situations where the price difference between different swap outcomes costs more than the ANTICIPATED price difference for the miner’s commission fees. When this difference in swap price is more than the difference in miner’s commission fees, the user will be presented with an option for a cheaper swap route. In situations where this occurs, users will also be given an option with a more expensive gas fee and a longer route to execute the swap, due to potential issues with liquidity."
